Pre-requisites
------------------------
    1. Javascript (ES6)
        Core Javascript Objects
        Functions are also objects
        Arrow Functions, IIFE 
        Sugar Syntax
            template leterals
            multi-line strings
            destructured assignments
        Array functions
        Array prototype functions
        Object Functions
        Spread Operator
    
    2. Node JS
        Javascript runtime enviroment
        npm 
        node project structure.

Enviroment
-------------------------
    NodeJS                  https://nodejs.org/en/
                            node -v
    
    NPM                     npm -v

    Angular CLI             npm install -g @angular/cli
                            ng --version
    
    Visual Studio Code      https://code.visualstudio.com/download

Node JS
------------------------------------

    is a runtime or execution platform for Javascript.

    node        
    npm     node package manager

            package is any Javascript library

    Create a node project:  npm init -y


Angular
------------------------------------------

    AngularJS 1   

            Developed on javascript
            Used only with javascript

    Angular 2 to  Angular 11

            Developed on javascript
            Used only with javascript and typescript
            It is recomemded to be used on typescript.

        Typescript = Javascript + Data Types (Type Safty)

        Brower can not understand typescript
        Hence we have to transcript (compile) typescript into javascript
        before we execute it on the Brower.

        babel       is mostly used for typescript to javascript compilation.

    Angular is used for developing SPA (client side application).

    SPA - Single Page Application.

    Angular applications are not executed on node.
    But they are developed on node platform.

    For the sake of
        package management
        compilation
        building distructable bundles
        testing
    we develop on node platform.

    once bundled, the bundle execute on browser.


    Creating an angular application on node

    1. create a project folder
    2. create a project using npm init -y
    3. install all libraries usign npm install
            angular core libraries
            bebel
            grun/gulp for project life cycle management
            karma for test execution
            jasmine for wrting test cases
            ................and other libraries

    Angular CLI comes to rescue

    Angular CLI
    --------------------------------------------
    Command line interface

        helps in creating a new angular project 
        with all required configuarations and installations.

        helps in crating angular building blocks.


        ng new projectName

        ng serve --port 4200 -o

                   starts the live angular development server
                            1. it compile all the existing typescript to javascript
                            2. the compiled code is not stored anywhere bu tis palce in-memory
                            3. it serves the code to the broser whenevr requested.
                            4. it monitors the angualr file and 
                                    any modification to any angular file
                                    will trigger the recompilation and restart of the servr.

        
        ng build            builds the distructable files 

                            1. it compile all the existing typescript to javascript
                            2. it stores the compiled code in the 'dist' folder.
