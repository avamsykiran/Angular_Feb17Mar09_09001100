Pre-requisites
------------------------
    1. Javascript (ES6)
        Core Javascript Objects
        Functions are also objects
        Arrow Functions, IIFE 
        Sugar Syntax
            template leterals
            multi-line strings
            destructured assignments
        Array functions
        Array prototype functions
        Object Functions
        Spread Operator
    
    2. Node JS
        Javascript runtime enviroment
        npm 
        node project structure.

Enviroment
-------------------------
    NodeJS                  https://nodejs.org/en/
                            node -v
    
    NPM                     npm -v

    Angular CLI             npm install -g @angular/cli
                            ng --version
    
    Visual Studio Code      https://code.visualstudio.com/download

Node JS
------------------------------------

    is a runtime or execution platform for Javascript.

    node        
    npm     node package manager

            package is any Javascript library

    Create a node project:  npm init -y


Angular
------------------------------------------

    AngularJS 1   

            Developed on javascript
            Used only with javascript

    Angular 2 to  Angular 11

            Developed on javascript
            Used only with javascript and typescript
            It is recomemded to be used on typescript.

        Typescript = Javascript + Data Types (Type Safty)

        Brower can not understand typescript
        Hence we have to transcript (compile) typescript into javascript
        before we execute it on the Brower.

        babel       is mostly used for typescript to javascript compilation.

    Angular is used for developing SPA (client side application).

    SPA - Single Page Application.

    Angular applications are not executed on node.
    But they are developed on node platform.

    For the sake of
        package management
        compilation
        building distructable bundles
        testing
    we develop on node platform.

    once bundled, the bundle execute on browser.


    Creating an angular application on node

    1. create a project folder
    2. create a project using npm init -y
    3. install all libraries usign npm install
            angular core libraries
            bebel
            grun/gulp for project life cycle management
            karma for test execution
            jasmine for wrting test cases
            ................and other libraries

    Angular CLI comes to rescue

    Angular CLI
    --------------------------------------------
    Command line interface

        helps in creating a new angular project 
        with all required configuarations and installations.

        helps in crating angular building blocks.


        ng new projectName

        ng serve --port 4200 -o

                   starts the live angular development server
                            1. it compile all the existing typescript to javascript
                            2. the compiled code is not stored anywhere bu tis palce in-memory
                            3. it serves the code to the broser whenevr requested.
                            4. it monitors the angualr file and 
                                    any modification to any angular file
                                    will trigger the recompilation and restart of the servr.

        
        ng build            builds the distructable files 

                            1. it compile all the existing typescript to javascript
                            2. it stores the compiled code in the 'dist' folder.


        ng g component ComponentName
        ng g directive DirectiveName
        ng g pipe PipeName
        ng g service ServiceName
        ng g module ModuleName
        ng g class ClassName
        


Day 2
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

    SPA?

            Single Page Application

            1. These application have one and only page (html docuemnt) .
            2. This page is composed of different 
                dynamically loadable and replaceble sections called COMPONENTS.
            

            DataServer <---> WebServer <----------URL---------- Client
                                        --html,css,javascript----> old page must unlaod

    Angular Achetecture (Buidling Blocks) ?

            The SPA framewworks/libraries like angular
            add extandability to HTML.

            We can create and use our own HTML elements and attributes.

            Modules

                    Logical group of Directives,Components,Pipes,Service and
                    other modules.

                    Root Module
                        Every Angular Application must be inside
                        on single module called Root Module.

                    Feature Module

                        Inside the root module 
                        we can include any otehr sub-modules called Feature Modules

                    @NgModule({

                    })
                    class MyModule {

                    }

            Directives

                    Are the one that add extendability to HTML.

                    Component Directives    in short known as Component
                            Each component is a user defiend HTML Tag (Element).

                    Attributes Directives   in short known as Directive
                            Each Directive is a user defiend HTML Attribute.

                        Structural Directives

                            ngIf
                            ngSwitch
                            ngFor

                        Event Directives

                            click
                            dblClick
                            blur
                            ....etc

                        Built-In Directives

                            ngModel
                            ngForm
                            readonly
                            routeLink
                            ...etc
                        
                        Custome Attribute Directives

                            @Directive({

                            })
                            class MyDirective{

                            }


            Components      (Component Directives)

                    Each component is a user defiend HTML Tag (Element).

                    Component = Template + Controller

                    BuiltIn Components
                        <ng-tempalte></ng-tempalte>

                        async


    Routing
    -------------------------------------------------------

        is render a specific component 
        based on the given URL.

        http://localhost:5656           Component0
        http://localhost:5656/c1        Component1
        http://localhost:5656/c2        Component2
        http://localhost:5656/c3        Component3

        RouterModule from /router
        
        <router-outlet></router-outlet> is a buitl-in component that acts like a placeholder

        Define Routes which is an array of Route; and each 
        Route  has the below properties
            path
            pathMatch
            component
            children
            ......

        routerLink is a attribute directive used on <a></a> to specify the link.
        
        Router   is a service used to navigate programatically.
                .navigateBy?Url("destinationUrl");
                .navigate([anArrayOfURLSegments],{qryPArams,routeParams});


        Path Parameters
        ---------------------------
            : is used to represent a path param.

            /abc/:name      'abc' is the url-segment and :name is a param

            http://localhost:5656/abc/vamsy
            http://localhost:5656/abc/Kiran

            ActivatedRoute is a inbuilt service that
            provides varioaus data about the current url.

                    params      is a observable the gives
                                all path params.

    Service:
    --------------------------------------------------------

        Service is a class that 
        offers bussiness logic,

        Service is injectables in angular.
        Service can be injected into a component,pipe, or a directive.

        @Injectable({
            providedIn:'root'
        })
        export class MyService{

        }   

/....../
        constructor(private obj:MyService){

        }



    Component LifeCycle Hooks
    -------------------------------------------

    LifeCycle                       Hooks

    At the time of loading:         ngOnChanges
                                    ngOnInit
                                    ngDoCheck

     compoennt data binding         ngOnChanges    
     might change                   ngDoCheck
                                    

     Content Initialization         ngAfterContnetInit    
                                    ngAfterContnetChecked    

     Child View Initialization      ngAfterViewInit
                                    ngAfterViewChecked

     Destroy                        ngOnDestroy    


Template Driven Forms
----------------------------------------

    1. form are crated in template and we bind them
        using ngModel.

    2. FormsModule

    3. is ok for simple forms, but not suggested for complex forms.

    4. it is not to test a template driven form.

    5. limited validations and limited for data binding.   

Model Driven Forms / Reactive Forms
-----------------------------------------

    1. ReactiveFormsModule

    2. The form model is constructed on controller, and 
        then the form control are boudn to template.

    3. Less on the template.

    4. great support for validations and Custom validations.

    5. suggested to work with complex forms.

Asynchronous Programming
-----------------------------------

    setTimeout
    setInterval

Reactive Programming
---------------------------

    the asynchronous jobs will have to notify the UI
    that the job is done or aborted. And the UI shall react to the the notification.

    Promise is a class the asures the UI that he will get back once the job is done or aborted.

    let job = (resolve,reject) => {
            ...code our job.....

            if(job is compelted)
                resolve(results); //signal successful completion
            else {
                reject(err); //signal the abortion
            }    
    };

    let p = new Promise(job); // the 'then' method when called will execute the job.

    p.then(
        (result) -> { }, //is called when the resolve signal is emited
        (err) -> { }, //is called when the rejct signal is emited.
    );

RxJS
-----------------------------------------

    Reactive JS

    Observable is an enchanced Promise.

    + one Observable can be subscribed by mor than one segments.
    + we can unsubscribe to an Observable
    + we can produce continouse resutls even before the job is complete.

    const job = (observer) =>{
        ...cdoe of the job....

        observer.next(value); //used to emit a value 
        observer.error(err); //signals the abortion due to err 
        observer.complete(); //signal completion.
    }

    let ob = new Observable(job); //job exectue when we subscribe.

    ob.subscribe(
        (value) => {}, //responds to the next()
        (err) => {}, //respond on error
        () => {} //respond on completion
    );

json-server
--------------------------------

 is a javascript library
 used to compose fake rest api.

 should be supplied witha a json file
 containing all json data, And
 each entity is identified by an 'id'.


HttpClient
-------------------------------------------------

    HttpClientModule            @angular/commons/http
        
        HttpClient          in-built service

            get(url)                Observable
